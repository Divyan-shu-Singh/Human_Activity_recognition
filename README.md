## Problem Statement
Recognizing human activities accurately and automatically using sensor data is a challenging task. This project aims to develop an application that can accurately recognize human activities using smartphone datasets. The collected sensor data will be processed, features will be extracted, and machine learning algorithms will be trained to classify activities into predefined categories.

## Features
#### Data Collection:
Collect smartphone sensor data from a diverse set of individuals performing various activities such as walking, running, sitting, standing, and climbing stairs.

#### Data Processing: 
Remove noise, fill missing values, and convert the data into a usable format for machine learning.

#### Feature Extraction: 
Extract useful features from the sensor data, such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency domain features.

#### Model Training: 
Train machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, random forest) using the extracted features and corresponding activity labels.
#### Model Evaluation: 
Evaluate the performance of the trained models on a separate test dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### Deployment: 
Deploy the trained model as a mobile application that can recognize human activities in real-time using the smartphone sensor data.

#### Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Dataset." It includes labeled data for activities such as walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, standing, sitting, and lying. The dataset is divided into two parts: a raw dataset and a pre-engineered dataset with classical machine learning models for activity prediction.
